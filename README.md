# React Native App

<p>For this project I wanted to poke around React Native with some basic functions that it offers and I loved it! I created some screens, some functions and components which was very fun, I then used "Expo app" on my mobile for development insted of a simulator because of CPU usage. I also installed a library which is autocorrect dropdown which is very cool, and there is of corse a huge amout of librarys to expolore, which can help in faster development with react native. I think that this framework is a must when it comes to mobile app development and I could see myself learn more about it and use it in the future. I don't have much more to say about it expect that it is easy to setup, and fairly easy to get started with when you are developing a mobile app if you know react.
